Made with üß° by [Aesthisia](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aesthisia)

New age web based container management &amp; logging platform for developers.

Exopods is a platform for containerization and management of applications. This logging platform aims to simplify the process of managing and monitoring Docker containers and their logs.

Current version `rc-1.0.01` is a alpha release, You might encounter some issues. We have already listed the know issues if you are facing any other issues, feel free to raise an issue in this repo.

## Features

- Easy management of Docker containers.
- Real-time logging for Docker containers.
- Search and filter logs by container, image, and time.
- Automatic rotation and archival of logs.
- Multiple methods for integrating logs into external systems such as Elasticsearch or Logstash.

## Getting Started

To get started with exopods platform, you need to have a basic understanding of Docker and its containers. You also need to have Docker installed on your system.
Note: Currently exopods support only linux/amd64 based os images. 

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose(optional)

## Installation

‚ùó‚ùó Important: Before starting the container make sure you change the `HOST_URL`, it should be same as the host, in which you will be accessing the exopods. For example: if you are using ec2 linux, use public ip as host url, `http://xx.xxx.xx.xx:8001`

### Deploy on docker host

Exopod application will be running on internal port 8001 inside the container, you can change external port by passing the `-p <external-port>:8001`, internal port can not be changed.



> sudo docker run -d -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e "HOST_URL=http://localhost" --name exopods -p 8001:8001 aesthisia/exopods:rc-1.0.01



For example

If you are running on a port(e.g. 8001)
the HOST_URL="http://13.65.23.234:8001"

If you are running on 80
the HOST_URL="http://13.65.23.234"


### Deploy on docker-compose

Clone the repo or copy & create a docker-compose.yaml & paste the content from the file present in this repo. Also make sure to change the `HOST_URL` in docker-compose.yml. 

```
sudo docker-compose up -d
```


Navigate to the host url & you will be redirected to the login page. Also make sure desired port is open & not being blocked by your firewall. Default username is `admin` & password `exopods`


### Usage

The logging platform provides an intuitive web interface for managing and monitoring Docker containers and their logs. You can perform the following tasks:

- View a list of all containers and their status.
- Start, stop, and restart containers(To be added)
- View logs for a specific container in real-time.
- Search and filter logs by container, image, and time.(To be added)

To check the logs:

You can click on little file icon on the container list page or you can check the logs by clicking View Logs in container detail page.

## Version
